## üöÄ Installation

To get the Smart Bell application up and running, follow these steps. The project is primarily developed using Flutter (Dart) for the front-end, with potential native integrations using C++, Swift, and Kotlin.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
*   [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (version 3.x or higher recommended)
*   [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android development)
*   [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS/macOS development)
*   [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (for C++ components)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Start by cloning the `smart-bell` repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/artisticshashank/smart-bell.git
    cd smart-bell/shashank_smart_bell_v2
    ```

2.  **Install Flutter Dependencies**
    Navigate into the primary project directory and fetch all necessary Flutter packages:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment (Optional, for native components)**
    If there are specific C++ or native (Swift/Kotlin) components that require configuration, you might need to run CMake or platform-specific setup.

    For C++ components (if applicable):
    ```bash
    # This is a placeholder. Actual commands depend on how C++ is integrated.
    # flutter build cmake_components
    ```

4.  **Run the Application**

    *   **For Android:**
        Ensure an Android emulator is running or a device is connected.
        ```bash
        flutter run
        ```

    *   **For iOS:**
        Ensure an iOS simulator is running or a device is connected (requires macOS and Xcode).
        ```bash
        flutter run
        ```

    *   **For Web:**
        ```bash
        flutter run -d web-server
        ```

    *   **For Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux):**
        ```bash
        flutter run -d windows # or macos, linux
        ```

    The application should launch, and you can begin setting up your bell schedules.


## üí° Usage

The Smart Bell application provides an intuitive interface for managing bell schedules.

### Basic Schedule Setup

1.  **Launch the App:** After installation, open the Smart Bell application.
2.  **Navigate to Schedules:** On the main dashboard, find the "Schedules" or "Bell Timings" section.
3.  **Create New Schedule:** Click on the "Add New Schedule" button.
4.  **Define Timings:** Input the start time, end time, days of the week, and select a bell tone for each event.
5.  **Save:** Save your schedule, and the system will automatically activate it.

### Example Configuration

You can configure various aspects of your bell system, such as different bell tones for various events or specific schedules for exam periods.

| Option             | Description                                          | Default Value |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| `DefaultTone`      | The default sound played for regular bells.          | `bell_1.mp3`  |
| `ExamScheduleMode` | Enable/disable special schedules for exam periods.   | `false`       |
| `NotificationDelay`| Delay in seconds before a bell rings (for warnings). | `0`           |
